## PythonFinalProject

For my final project in my Python course, I was asked to build something original. 
I chose a project that would use almost everything I had learned during the course.
This is an electronic bankbook to track deposits and withdrawls.
It was built using Python 3.5, Tkinter, and SQLite3.

As a user adds entries to the bankbook, it will store and display: 
  * The amount added or subtracted,
  * The time and date of the entry
  * A user-entered note about the entry
  * The current balance
